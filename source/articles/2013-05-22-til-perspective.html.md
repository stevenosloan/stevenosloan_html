its been tight and stressful, one of those things that dealing with the “icky” parts of development — those languages you don’t really like (looking at you php), working around inflexible platform limitations, that general tomfoolery you pull when the deadline is too short to do it “right” and you know it won’t blow up on you in the future.

> I *got* to learn ____

doing a recap of sorts and as we started through things I jokingly said, "I *got* to learn some regex warts in php". That trend continued and something funny happened -- it really clicked to talk about these "issues" as learning "oportunities". There is something definitevely adventagious to framing our issues this way, as "fun" (in the woodworking sense) as they may be.

It reminds me of the "war stories" that older devs and sys-admin guys have. There's always a laugh, and a sense of "we got through it". It's easy to frame our past struggles in this way -- but not as easy for our close problems. 

Just because it's not weeks in the past, doesn't mean we can't take a "we got through it", "we learned from it" view of our problems -- and doing so has a net possitive effect

instead of saying "ugh, I had to deal with _____" try "today I got to learn _____".
